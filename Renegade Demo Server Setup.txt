CLIENT CONNECTION SPEED 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is very important that your game is setup to use the correct connection
speed for your Internet connection.  If the connection speed is not setup
properly, it will drastically affect your game performance.  This setting
communicates to the server how frequently your game should update.  If it
is set too low, the server does not update your client as often as it could.
If this value is set too high, the server may flood your game with too
much information.  

Because of this the game will automatically detect your bandwidth. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SERVER CONNECTION SPEED 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are setting up a server, it is important that your connection speed
is setup correctly.  The connection speed for the server determines how
frequently clients connected to the server are updated. This has a direct
effect on the experienced "lag" of the players connected to your server. 

The game will automatically determine your bandwidth and use it to determine 
the appropriate number of players your game can host. The number of players
is scaled up using the following criteria:

 Upload Bandwidth equal to or greater than 0.5 Mbps allows up to 8 players
 Upload Bandwidth equal to or greater than 1.0 Mbps allows up to 16 players
 Upload Bandwidth equal to or greater than 2.0 Mbps allows up to 32 players
  

Cable modems and DSL with an upload bandwidth of 128k/sec are NOT allowed 
to host.

To promote the best gameplay experience for all of our players, the server
is automatically set to a dedicated server.
